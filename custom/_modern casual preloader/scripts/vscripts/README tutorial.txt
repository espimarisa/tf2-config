What's going on here?

If you want to disable hat mods in Casual, move cosmetic_models.nut into the "disabled" folder 
(Loading cosmetics only increases load times by 3.3 seconds so it's not rlly worth it)

I'm testing out a system to make the preloader more modular. No clue if I'll expand on it atm


Make a copy of "extra_models EXAMPLE.nut" and rename it to "extra_models.nut" if you 
want to add any models missed by the preloader. This file won't get replaced by updates,
so you can keep your preloader list safe knowing that they won't get wiped.
(If you leave a comment tho I'll probably just add the models in the next update)


If none of this makes any sense, then DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.
